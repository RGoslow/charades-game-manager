# charades-game-manager
This project computerizes all aspects of a charades/word guessing game that is normally played with pen, paper, and a timer. The full rules of this game are described here: https://pastebin.com/WPXtPBig. 

This program will:

  -Allow players to enter their names and choose a teammate
  
  -Allow players to enter their chosen words/phrases
  
  -Randomly present phrases to players
  
  -Maintain the "hot potato" timer
  
  -Total scores at the end of each round and declare a winning team

This program will have a simple GUI created with tkinter. The idea is that it will run on a single device which would be passed from player to player as the game is played.
