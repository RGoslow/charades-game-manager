THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CREATED/FOUND FOR THIS PROJECT:

1. Home screen that allows users to start the game, read the rules, and see the credits

2. Interface for users to enter names and phrases

Progress: not started

3. Function/logic to randomize phrase order behind the scenes

Progress: not started

4. Ability to show phrases while tracking time with the timer widget (https://github.com/ostcrom/python-tk-timer-widget) and keeping score.

Progress: have tested timer widget, but have not modified it to fit project purpose.

5. OPTIONAL: Ability to export all phrases to txt file at game's end.
